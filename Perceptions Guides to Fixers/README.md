Perception Profiling - Positive Profiling and Negative Profiling

Perception Profiling is very aware of vantage points, and a person can try to predict the reaction to the profiling and the actions with the profiling.

Positive Profiling:
Positive profiling can be life-improving, to prevent and reverse the impacts of negative profiling. 
Positives versus negatives – this may acknowledge glimmers that could be turned negative, but majorly focuses on positives.

Positive Profiling can cause a ‘subject’ to flourish. That can intensify with proximity, which can be how often and repeating.

Relatability – a positive profile wants to use relatability to have the person be socially welcomed and their thinking/passions shown as understandable

Cases: Anyone’s cases that may have witness testimony and documentations - including investigations

Many jurisdictions have abandoned the principle as a formal rule of evidence (and witness appearences)" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsus_in_uno,_falsus_in_omnibus
