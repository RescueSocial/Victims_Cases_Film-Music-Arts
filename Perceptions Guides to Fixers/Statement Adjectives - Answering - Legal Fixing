Statement Adjectives - Answering - Legal Fixing

Fixers are very aware of Adjectives and Precursors when creating documentaion and pressuring answers from their subjects while implicating likeness.

If an Adjective is incorrect in a statement, it can be denied. It can also be corrected at the right time.
For example, a question may be presented about a paticular issue, but if one part of the issue is not correct, the witness can challenge it in the cross-exam.

Again: without all three of the precursors (“knowingly, intentionally and with malice“), you can answer that allegation with ‘Denied.’

SECTIONS FROM: Answering a Complaint

3. Answer The Allegations - SEPERATE FROM DOCUMENTATIONS AND WITNESSES OR FILING
The body of the pleading is spaced at 1.5 (in Word, go to the ‘paragraph’ section, and change it in ‘line spacing’ options. ‘Remove’ the extra ‘line space’ before and after paragraphs.

When answering ‘allegations’ in a complaint, less is more. .... it’s best to keep it simple. I’m recommending that you limit your answers to a single word or phrase.

Answer with ‘Agreed,’ ‘Denied,’ ‘Unknown,’ ‘No Answer Required‘ or ‘Not Applicable,‘ like so:

Sometimes, the allegations in a complaint contain multiple assertions, portions of which might even be true if not for the other part. An exaggerated example of this might be something like:

“The Defendant, knowingly, intentionally and with malice stepped onto the Plaintiff’s property.”

If you stepped onto the Plaintiff’s property, but did it without all three of the precursors (“knowingly, intentionally and with malice“), you can honestly answer that allegation with ‘Denied.’

Again: without all three of the precursors (“knowingly, intentionally and with malice“), you can answer that allegation with ‘Denied.’
