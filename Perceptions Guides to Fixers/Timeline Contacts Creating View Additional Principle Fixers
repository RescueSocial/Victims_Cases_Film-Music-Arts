Fixers Bind:
Contacts Creating a View of Allegedly Additional Principles over Timeline

A Fixer, focused on manufacturing documentation and their implications being binding, chooses to repeatedly contact and 'create' evidence against their victims.
Each dialogue, or interaction, is a part of their 'stack' for their manufactured false evidence.
Hollywood Fixers, in paticular being on the forefront, deliberately 'associate' themselves to implications,
with the desire to implicate 'pulling both ends' against their victim.
For example, even after being directed by the opposition, they will continue to contact their victims and former clients.
Meaning, without laws, they will continue to exploit information, witnesses, people, and clients they had.

They will 'show' their stacks of 'contacting' as they claim their authority. Even if the person they contact, is victimized by them.
This can include emails, audio recordings (which they edit),
Through this, they create an uninterupted deception, to those who look on the face to believe what they say/claim, of who they are victimizing.
Financial implications are even worse - trying to manipulate the lack of laws against coercion, which does not require a financial transaction.
They claim their initial or single contact with their subject, is a contact never-ending.

They will allege to their victims that they have additional Principles, then the one they primarily and in total, 'work for.'
As the victim has communications from the fixer, their lawyer, overcharging them and trained to see the 'at the face' will then retaliate against the victim.
See for example: Jude Greene Case
Witnesses, who are victimized, see the same fate, without coercion laws in California, where fixers doing most contacts reside.
